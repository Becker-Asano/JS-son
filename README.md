# js-son - a Minimal JavaScript BDI Agent Library

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TimKam/JS-son.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TimKam/JS-son)

``js-son`` is a minimal JavaScript library for implementing intelligent agents that follow the belief, desire, intention approach.
Install it with:

```
npm install js-son
```

## Belief, Desire, Intention Agents: a Minimal Approach

Belief: what the agent beliefs about the state of its environment, as well as about is own state

Desires: changes in the state the agent would like to achieve

Intentions:


## Requirements & Installation
Installing ``js-son`` requires [npm](https://nodejs.org/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com).

To install ``js-son``, run:

```
npm install js-son
```

or:

```
yarn add js-son
```

## Usage

Run example

## Instantiating a new Agent

## Creating a Custom Agent *Prototype*

## Examples
To show how JS-son can be used in combination with modern data science and web technologies, we provide two examples:

* Example 1

* Example 2

### Multi-agent Simulation with Jupyter Notebook

### Distributed Multi-agent System

## Supported Platforms
``js-son`` supports recent versions of Firefox, Chrome, and Node.js.
It is not tested for other platforms and does not use [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to facilitate compatibility with legacy platforms.
Contributions that change this are welcome!

## Testing
The project uses [Jasime](https://jasmine.github.io/2.0/node.html) for testing.
Run the tests with ``npm test``.
The tests also run on Travis-CI.

## Documentation
``js-son`` is documented with [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/). Generate the documentation by running: ``npm run doc``.
The documentation will be placed (as HTML files) to the ``out`` directory.

## Contributions
We welcome contributions.
Before you create a pull request, ensure the tests pass and add test cases that cover the code you contribute.
